## Assignment 2 - Submit Your GitHub Repo

#### Due: 07-09-2025

---

## 🚩 Objective

Submit your GitHub repository URL and confirm that your profile and README are correctly configured. This ensures I can find your repo and that it meets minimum requirements before grading begins.

## ✅ What To Do

1. **Submit the URL to your GitHub repo**

   - Example: `https://github.com/username/3013-Algorithms`

2. **Double-check your main README**
   It should contain:

   - Your full name
   - Your email
   - Course title and number
   - Your GitHub username
   - A real photo (not an avatar)
   - A short bio or fun fact (optional but encouraged)

3. **Confirm your repo is Public**

   - If it's private, make sure you’ve sent me a collaborator invite.

4. **Assignments folder exists**

   - Make sure the `Assignments/` directory exists and has at least `A01/` with a README inside.

5. **Submit the form**

   - A Google Form (or LMS form) link will be provided in class/Slack. Paste your repo link and click submit.

## 🧠 Why This Mini-Assignment?

This step prevents 100+ emails asking, “Did you get my code?” or “Why is my grade a zero?” This is your **receipt of submission** and your check-in to ensure you’ve met the course standards.

Also, you’ll thank yourself later when it’s time to show off your GitHub profile.

## 📎 Pro Tips

- Bookmark your repo!
- Share your repo in our course chat so others can get inspo from your README design.
- Don’t upload .zip files unless explicitly asked — push commits, not folders.

_Missing this assignment = I don’t have your repo = zeroes until resolved._
