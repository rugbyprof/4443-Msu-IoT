## Assignment 1 - GitHub Repo Setup

#### Due: 07-08-2025

---

## 🚩 Objective

Set up a GitHub repository that will serve as the central hub for all of your assignments in this course. This repo is **required**, and should be structured and documented like a portfolio-quality project.

---

## ✅ GitHub Setup Instructions

1. **Create a GitHub Account**

   - If you don’t already have one, create an account at: [https://github.com](https://github.com)
   - Choose a username you’re comfortable sharing (it becomes part of your public profile).

2. **Create a New Repository**

   - [Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)
   - Repo name format: ` COURSEID-COURSENAME (e.g., ``3013-Algori `thms)
   - Add a README.md when creating the repo (check the box).
   - Set it to **Public** (preferred) unless we’ve discussed otherwise.

3. **Edit Your README.md** (Top-Level Repo README)
   This will be the “face” of your repo. Include:

   ```markdown
   ## Full Name

   ## Course Info (e.g., 3013 Algorithms)

   ## Email

   ## GitHub Username

   ## Website (optional)

   ## Photo (required)

   <img src="your_image_url_or_file" width="200">
   ```

4. **Organize Your Repository**
   Your repo should contain a folder named `Assignments/` and inside that:

   ```
   Assignments/
   ├── A01/
   │   ├── README.md
   │   ├── main.cpp (or .py, etc.)
   ├── A02/
   │   ├── README.md
   │   ├── ...
   └── README.md  (a summary table of all assignments)
   ```

5. **Assignments Folder README Format**
   In `Assignments/README.md`, maintain a summary table:

   ```markdown
   | #   | Folder        | Description         |
   | --- | ------------- | ------------------- |
   | A01 | [A01](./A01/) | Basic GitHub Setup  |
   | A02 | [A02](./A02/) | Hello World Project |
   ```

6. **Each Assignment Folder README**
   Each `README.md` inside an assignment folder should include:

   - Project Title
   - Student Name
   - Project Description (summary of the assignment goals)
   - Table of Files with Descriptions and Links
   - Run Instructions
   - Notes on Known Issues or Requirements

7. **Use Images When Appropriate**
   Screenshots or circuit photos help tell your project’s story. Upload them to the folder or use an external image host like [imgbox](https://imgbox.com/).

## 🤓 Why This Matters

GitHub is **not just for turning things in** — it's your personal dev portfolio. Organized code, clear READMEs, and commit history show you’re not just learning — you’re documenting your growth. Plus, this is what industry expects.
