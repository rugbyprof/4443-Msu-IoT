🧠 Tips to Max Out Your README Score
• Don’t just copy/paste — explain what your code actually does.

⚠️ Remember

A README is not just for your professor. It’s your project’s elevator pitch to the world.

You’re allowed to make it fun, quirky, artistic, professional, clean, or any mix of those — as long as it’s usable.
