## Assignment 3: README Mastery & Project Documentation

#### Due: 07-10-2025

⸻

## 🚩 Objective

Create and maintain consistent, high-quality documentation for all course assignments using README.md files. This assignment focuses on your Assignments/ folder structure and how each project is presented.

⸻

### 📁 Your Assignment Directory Structure

Inside your GitHub repo:

```
Assignments/
├── README.md          # Table of contents for all assignments
├── A01/
│   ├── README.md      # Project-specific info
│   └── main.cpp
├── A02/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── hello.py
└── ...
```

⸻

📝 Root README.md in Assignments/

This file acts as a directory of projects. Include a table like this:

| #   | Folder        | Description             |
| --- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| A01 | [A01](./A01/) | GitHub Setup Assignment |
| A02 | [A02](./A02/) | Hello World Program     |

Update this table after every assignment.

⸻

🧾 README.md Format for Each Assignment Folder

Each assignment should have its own README.md with the following:

## Project Title

### Student Name

### Files

| #   | Filename | Description             |
| --- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| 1   | main.py  | Main script             |
| 2   | utils.py | Helper functions module |

### Instructions

🧠 Why This Matters

README files aren’t just fluff — they make your code usable, shareable, and professional. Future you (or future employers) will appreciate the polish.

⸻

🧪 Submission
• No formal submission — just keep your repo up to date.
• I’ll grade based on your repo’s documentation as we go.

⸻

README files are your digital voice. Make ’em count.
